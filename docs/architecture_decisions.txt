Use API Restful, with protocol HTTP Because client can use in any browser to access frontend

Connection Route:
Still using the Restful API protocol, because the HTTPS protocol is easier to communicate with the client than gRPC and kafka

Person Route:
Still using the Restful API protocol, because the HTTPS protocol is easier to communicate with the client than gRPC and kafka

Location Route:
I will change message passing to gRPC with protocol buffer and Kafka with protocol TCP
Since location is not called in any client api, therefore I can easy to change message passing.
